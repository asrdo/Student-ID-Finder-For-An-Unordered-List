# Student-ID-Finder-For-An-Unordered-List
This program finds the student IDs for a list of scrambled student names.

The program receives 2 files:
1. A comma-separated dataset (.csv file) consisting of two entries, the student names and their IDs. (This is the database of the program)
2. The list of scrambled student names that you want to find the IDs for. 

This program will return a (.csv) file containing the list of scrambled student names along with their IDs that the program found.

This program is fully created and coded by me. Regenerating this code under your name is strictly intolerated.

You are free to download and experiment with this code as you wish, and suggest upgrades.

This repository contains:
1. The main executable file.
2. The two example input files.
3. The source code.
